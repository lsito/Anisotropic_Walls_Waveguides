# Anisotropic_Walls_Waveguides
Codes for computing the fields distribution in a waveguide with anisotropic walls following the Modal Theory.
- Benchmarked dispersion curves with analytical solution for metallic waveguides
- Fields benchmarked for TE10, TE11, TM11 modes

Still a lot of things to be done:
- Still doubts on the benchmark with the paper of Raveau
- Still have to benchmark the absorption curves for the metallic waveguides
- Try to do the computation of the absorption coefficient with different impedances
- See if in simulation it is possible to have an anisotropic impedance
- What would be realistic values of real part of Zz and Zt
